# ABUS-segmentation-and-classification
Near Completed Graduation project

Use designed and refined deep learning network to segment and classify the Automated Breast Ultrasound Images (ABUS), based on Unet, residual and attention block. Compare them with classifc network, like unet++. Currently acheieve mIoU beyond 77%, better than some published models. It proves the feasibility in the performance.

Specific classific model, files_dir and dataset are not provided. Dataset is offered by a ZJU cooperated hospital. I promised to protect the safety and privacy.

Some parts are completely written indivually. Some parts refer to the open source network structure.
